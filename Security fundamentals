1. Which technology is used to create the multiple stimulated environments  by utilizing a physical instance of an infrastructural resources?
    A. Hypervision technology
    B. Virtualization technology
    c. Infrastructural technology
ANS : (b)

2. Which software program enables hardware to host multiple virtual machines ?
Ans:  Hypervisor
Explanation :   hypervisors have the ability to allocate physical machine resources to VMs in a dynamic manner .

3. what is the function of server virtualisation?
ANS : It deploy VMM on the server and divide the single physical server into multiple virtual servers

4. what is the function of Hardware virtualization ?
ANS : it installs VMM directly on the hardware system

5. What do cloud computing refers to?
Ans : deployment of multiple workloads or delivering the computing services such as servers,databases,storage

6. Explain different cloud computing models ?
ANS : 1. Software-as-a-service(Saas)
           2. platform-as-a-service(Paas)
            3. Infrastructure-as-a-service(Iaas)

7. Differentiate between Virtualization and cloud computing?
ANS : virtualization is a technology where as cloud computing is a environment
•	CC inherits the “You pay for what you need and use” consumption model

8.  What is Containerization in the cloud ?
ANS : It is an OS virtualization that builds and encapsulates software code. And it also eliminates the problem of porting code effectively from one infrastructure and another.It also eliminates the problem of cross-infrastructure

9. what are the characteristics of containers ?
A: portability, Lightweight and efficient ,single executable package, isolation, improved security, fault isolation , Easy operational management

10. what are the components of containerized applications ?
ANS : container hosts, registry server, container image, container engine/runtime, Namespace, Kernel namespace, tags, Repositories , graph driver

11. what does serverless computing architecture do ?
ANS : it allows to perform light weight cloud operations

12. Hoe you can embed security using DevOps ?
ANS : it is done by using 3 models
1.	DevOpsSec 2. DevSecOps 3. SecDevOps

13. What are cloud security pillars ?
ANS : Continuous security monitor
User security
Physical security
Storage resources security
Database security
Infrastructure security
Operating system security
Network security
Middleware security
Data security
Application security

14. How many Security assessment and testing approaches are there in cloud computing ?
ANS: 3 they are 1. Black box testing-----internal knowledge and details are not known and it is also called as “closed box testing”
2.	White box testing---internal knowledge and details are known and it is also called as “clear box testing”
3.	Grey box testing—both clear box and closed box testing are known


15. what are the three different types of application security ?
ANS : 1. Static application assessment testing
         2. dynamic application assessment testing
          3. Interactive application assessment testing
